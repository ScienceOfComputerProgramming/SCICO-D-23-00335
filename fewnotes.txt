* Old python scripts are moved to ./python/old ; they were used for experiments, and do not support general use of px-mbt.

* Earlier experiments are kept in eu.iv4xr.ux.pxtestingPipeline in src/test/java

* FASE23 data set is move one level lower to ./FASE23Dataset/FASE23Dataset. You can rerun FASE23 from this project, but you need to:
   * copy all scripts in ./FASE23Dataset to the project root 
   * move the data one level up to ./FASE23Dataset
   * you can run the scripts as instructed in replication-readme; you need a bash-like
     shell. You need an executable of Lab Recruits, placed in the right folder,
     but then you can use Windows exe of Mac exe that will actually show the game
     (the linux version has no display/it is headless).
